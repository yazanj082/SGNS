# SGNS

implement the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS) variant of the Word2Vec algorithm to build word embeddings for Arabic content. Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words that capture their semantic and syntactic properties based on the distributional hypothesis: words that occur in similar contexts are likely to have similar meanings. Word embeddings are useful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, information retrieval, and machine translation.

Here are the steps followed:
1.	Dataset selection and preprocessing: Choose a corpus of Arabic text that is representative of your NLP task or interest. Preprocess the corpus by removing stop words, punctuation marks, and diacritical marks (if any). You may also want to perform tokenization and stemming, depending on your corpus and objectives. Save the preprocessed corpus as a plain text file.

2.	Building the vocabulary: Read the preprocessed corpus and create a vocabulary of unique words and their frequencies. You may want to apply a threshold to remove rare or very common words, depending on your computational resources and objectives


3.	Creating the skip-gram model: Implement the SGNS variant of the Word2Vec algorithm using the preprocessed corpus and vocabulary. The SGNS variant consists of training a binary classifier to distinguish between the positive pairs of (target word, context word) and the negative pairs of (target word, random word). The positive pairs are obtained by sliding a window of size W (e.g., 5) over the preprocessed corpus and considering the center word as the target word and its surrounding words as the context words. The negative pairs are obtained by randomly sampling k words from the vocabulary that are not in the context of the target word. The binary classifier is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The output of the skip-gram model is the learned word embeddings, which are the weights of the input (target) layer of the binary classifier.

4.	Evaluating the word embeddings: Evaluate the quality of the learned word embeddings by using them in a downstream NLP task or by computing their intrinsic evaluation metrics. Some possible evaluation metrics are cosine similarity, word analogy, and word clustering. You may also want to compare the performance of the SGNS variant with other variants of the Word2Vec algorithm, such as Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) or hierarchical softmax.
